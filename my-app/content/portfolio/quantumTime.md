# How I Built a Time Machine with Python and Quantum Computing

Have you ever dreamed of traveling to the past or the future? In this post, I will show you how I built a time machine with Python and quantum computing, and how you can do it too.

## The Idea

The idea of building a time machine came to me when I was watching Back to the Future for the 100th time. I wondered if it was possible to create a device that could manipulate the flow of time and allow me to visit different eras and places. I did some research and found out that there are some theoretical models of time travel, such as wormholes, closed timelike curves and quantum teleportation. However, none of them seemed feasible or practical with the current technology.

Then I stumbled upon an article that claimed that quantum computing could enable time travel. It said that quantum computers could exploit the superposition and entanglement of qubits to create a quantum state that could simulate a closed timelike curve, which is a loop in spacetime that allows an object to return to its own past. I was intrigued by this idea and decided to give it a try.

## The Tools

To build a time machine, I needed two things: a quantum computer and a programming language. For the quantum computer, I used IBM's Qiskit, which is an open-source framework that allows you to access real quantum devices and simulators online. For the programming language, I used Python, which is my favorite language and has many libraries and modules for quantum computing.

## The Code

The code for this project is available on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/johndoe/time-machine). You can also view my [Jupyter Notebook](https://johndoe.com/time-machine.ipynb) where I explain each step in detail and show some examples of time travel.

The code works as follows:

- First, I import the necessary libraries and modules, such as Qiskit, NumPy and Matplotlib.
- Next, I define a function that creates a quantum circuit with four qubits: one for the input state, one for the output state, one for the control qubit and one for the ancilla qubit. The input state represents the initial state of the object that wants to travel in time. The output state represents the final state of the object after traveling in time. The control qubit determines whether the object travels forward or backward in time. The ancilla qubit helps to create the entanglement between the input and output states.
- Then, I apply some gates to the circuit to create the desired quantum state. I use the Hadamard gate to put the control qubit in a superposition of 0 and 1. I use the CNOT gate to entangle the input and output states with the control qubit. I use the Toffoli gate to create a conditional phase shift between the input and output states depending on the value of the control qubit. I use the SWAP gate to swap the input and output states. Finally, I use the inverse Hadamard gate to measure the control qubit.
- After that, I run the circuit on a quantum simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execute function. I specify the number of shots or repetitions of the experiment and the backend or device that I want to use.
- Lastly, I plot the results using Qiskit's plot_histogram function. I show the probabilities of each possible outcome for the control qubit and the output state.

## The Results

The results are amazing. Depending on the value of the control qubit, I can see that the output state is either identical or opposite toHere is a possible crazy blog portfolio project post in markdown:

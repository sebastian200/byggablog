# The Most Crazy Thing Possible

## A story of a flying pig and a talking pineapple

Once upon a time, there was a **flying pig** named Piggles who lived in a farm with his friends. He loved to soar in the sky and feel the wind on his face. He also liked to eat apples and corn from the farmer's fields.

One day, he saw a strange fruit on a tree. It was yellow and spiky, and it smelled sweet. He flew over to the tree and took a bite of the fruit. To his surprise, the fruit spoke to him.

"Hey, what are you doing? That hurts!" the fruit said.

Piggles was shocked. He had never heard a fruit talk before.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"I'm a **pineapple**. My name is Pina. And you are a very rude pig," the fruit said.

Piggles felt sorry for biting the pineapple. He apologized and offered to be friends with her.

"Friends? With a pig? No way. You're dirty and smelly and you eat everything," Pina said.

Piggles was hurt by her words. He tried to explain that he was not like other pigs. He was special because he could fly.

"Fly? Yeah, right. And I can sing opera," Pina said sarcastically.

Piggles decided to prove her wrong. He flew up in the air and did a loop-de-loop. He then landed on the ground and smiled at Pina.

"See? I can fly," he said proudly.

Pina was amazed. She had never seen a flying pig before.

"Wow, you can fly. That's incredible. Maybe you're not so bad after all," she said.

Piggles was happy that Pina changed her mind. He asked her if she wanted to fly with him.

"Fly with you? How?" she asked.

Piggles had an idea. He grabbed Pina with his mouth and lifted her off the tree. He then flew around the farm, showing her the sights.

Pina was scared at first, but then she enjoyed the ride. She saw the cows, the chickens, the horses, and the barn. She also saw the farmer and his wife, who were surprised to see a flying pig and a talking pineapple.

"This is amazing! Thank you for showing me this," Pina said.

Piggles was glad that Pina liked it. He flew back to the tree and put her down gently.

"You're welcome. I had fun too," he said.

They smiled at each other and became friends.

The end.
